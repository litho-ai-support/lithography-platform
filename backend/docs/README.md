# Docs Index

For AIGC. Read less. Route first.

## Folders

- `docs/common/`: global architecture and shared conventions
- `docs/capabilities/`: stable semantic capability decisions referenced by code anchors
- `docs/api/`: API / GraphQL adapter rules
- `docs/worker/`: worker / queue / async-consumer rules
- `docs/project-convention/`: project-specific conventions
- `docs/generated/`: generated local observation docs; do not edit manually
- `docs/frontend/`: optional frontend-facing contract notes and cross-repo alignment drafts, not backend source of truth
- `docs/deprecated/`: historical design background only, not implementation guidance
- `plans/`: active plans, priorities, followups and deliverables
- Do not read `docs/human/` for implementation guidance

## Conflict Or Overlap Resolution

Before applying multiple rule documents, read `docs/common/rule-precedence.rules.md` first.

## Global GraphQL Error Contract

- Every GraphQL interface must follow `docs/api/graphql-error-contract-current.md`.
- AI agents must read it before changing GraphQL adapters, guards, exception filters, auth/session flows, or frontend-facing API docs.
- `errors[].extensions.code === 'UNAUTHENTICATED'` is the stable frontend runtime signal for auth/session failure.
- Frontend must not depend on `extensions.errorCode` for production runtime branching; it may be hidden or omitted.

  - `docs/capabilities/current.md` for current semantic boundaries
  - `docs/common/capability-boundary-examples.md` when a composition usecase looks like a capability
  - `docs/generated/capabilities-current.md` for the generated module-graph projection

  - backend truth still comes from `docs/api/*.md` and `docs/common/*.rules.md`

- Auth / session current contract:
  - `docs/api/graphql-error-contract-current.md`
  - `docs/api/auth-session-current.md`
